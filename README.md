# Aimed Labs Assignment Work

Task Description: Create cards that follow the responsive-design pattern. Specifically, the 
task requires you to create 2 different cards on the same screen:

Card 1 (The card at the top): As the screen size grows or shrinks, the width of the card 
changes to occupy the same proportion of the screen. Furthermore, the green-area inside it 
also grows to take the same proportion of the screen as before.

Card 2 (The card at the bottom): Ad the screen size grows or shrinks, the width of the card 
changes to occupy the same proportion of the screen. Furthermore, the green-area inside it 
also changes. Also note that, even though the size of the card is changing, the grey-area still 
maintains its size and remains at the top-center of the card.

Note: * The whole area represent a screen (mobile screen, web-browser screen, iPad
screen, etc). * The redish area is being referred to as a card. * Extra points if you can 
implement this without using “MediaQuery”.
